## Minor/Concentrations {#minor-concentrations}

### About the Minor/Concentration {#about-the-minor-concentration}

The Minor/Concentration provides depth and specific instruction in a particular field of the student’s greatest interest within Environmental Science. The concentration is required of all Environmental Science majors, and students earn a minor on the transcript and diploma when they graduate in six of the seven options.

### Choosing a Minor/Concentration {#choosing-a-minor-concentration}

Students typically decide which minor/concentration to choose based on experiences in the upper-division coursework for the major. To aid in that discovery we recommend choosing the major courses of greatest interest as early as possible to help decide a direction. Most students determine their concentration by the end of the sophomore year or early in the junior year. Students are encouraged to declare the minor prior to reaching 150 total units; after reaching 150 units students will have to make an appointment with their general academic counseling unit (CAC/AAP/Honors) for approval.

While the minors provide greater depth in a particular field, they should not be viewed as determining one’s future. The minor/concentration can help students enter a particular field for graduate school or for a professional opportunity, but should always be viewed as potentially opening doors, but not closing others. While a student choosing, for example, Environmental Engineering may go on to become an engineer, the option is still open to pursue public health, law, or almost any other path.

### Minor Unit Requirements {#minor-unit-requirements}

All minor/concentrations, with a little planning, will include the same number of courses. There is no longer or shorter path; all can be completed with 20 units that are unique to the minor. Typically this means that if a minor has 6 courses, one course can overlap with another part of one’s program (major or another minor); if it has 7 courses, two can overlap. However, the units are key, so courses that provide fewer than 4 units may change the number of courses one needs to reach 20 unique units in the minor.

### Declaring the Minor/Concentration {#declaring-the-minor-concentration}

Declaring a minor is usually a simple process. First, students should consult with the IoES SAO to declare the concentration, which then tracks progress in DARS. Royce will explain any additional steps the student must take prior to declaring the minor with the department that offers it (also detailed in the sections for the minors here).

Substitution requests for minors offered by a department other than the IoES must be made to and approved by that department. Each department has its own preferences for submitting such petitions. Consult with the department SAO for instructions. See the Appendix for a list of all departmental SAO contact information.

### Career Paths – Study What Interests You! {#career-paths-study-what-interests-you}

For many of you, as young scientists, choosing a career path may feel like a daunting challenge, and the decision of what to study to set yourself up for that career equally or even more intimidating. But here’s the good news: there are many, many fantastic career paths available to you after you graduate, whether you continue in environmental science or not, and the minor you pick will not, by itself, predict, or limit, your future. You should feel free to study what interests you, not what you think you need to study because it’s the only path to that exact right job.

According to a recent report by the U.S. Department of labor, on average people tend to change jobs _11 times_ between the ages of 18 and 44, and will change careers altogether two or three times in their lifetime. Your undergraduate education path will not define your career path, rather, it will provide you with a strong background as a scientist or professional in general for you to go forward and discover what it is you want to do.

This is not to say there aren’t reasons to potentially pick one minor over another. This is including whether you plan to potentially go on to a graduate program in a particular scientific discipline or for a professional program; there may be prerequisites you will need to have taken in the program subject area. But even if you decide to change course later, there are almost always opportunities to build the background needed for graduate study in a different field. Just because you minor in conservation biology does not mean you can never get a PhD in climate science! The important thing is to find a course of study will be passionate about, do well, and keep moving forward. Your choice of minor is an important first step, but only a first step toward figuring out what you will do next!

#### A Guide to the Environmental Engineering Minor {#a-guide-to-the-environmental-engineering-minor}

General Comments

This minor was originally conceived as a component of the BS in Environmental Science, offered by the Institute of the Environment, but may be of interest to students from other programs.

There are no prerequisite “traps” in the list of courses. The required course CEE 153 has only a recommended prerequisite of MAE 103, but more than a decade of experience has shown that students can achieve well in CEE 153 without having taken MAE 103\. All other courses used to satisfy the minor have at most CEE 153 as a prerequisite. However, EHS C125 and C164 do recommend additional chemistry courses.

Unless the twenty unique unit requirement for a minor is lifted, students in HSSEAS majors can use this minor to satisfy only two of the TBR requirements in Civil and Environmental Engineering.

The requirement for a minimum grade of C in each course may be appealed in the case of a C-, but generally not in the case of any D grade. Consideration of appeals in the case of a C- grade will take into account the student’s overall academic record.

Acceptable Course Substitutes

The list of elective courses specified in the minor requirements is limited to courses that may be taken without prerequisites, but many other subjects are appropriate to satisfy this minor. Up to _three_ UCLA courses in the list below will be “automatically” approved as substitutes for the five upper-division elective requirements. Requests for more than three substitutions and for transferred courses will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Note that, because some of the courses listed below may have additional prerequisites, students should consult the instructors of these courses to determine if they have adequate preparation.

_Acceptable course substitutes:_

**AOS** 104 (acceptable as substitute for CEE 153, but not in addition to CEE 153), 141 (credit for both AOS 141 and CEE 163 will not be granted)

**CEE** 110, 150, 151, 152, 156B, 157A, 157B, 157C, 157L, 157M, 163 **ChE** 100, 101A, 101B, 101C, 102A, 102B, 106, 113, C119, C140 (credit for both MAE 105A

and ChE 102A will not be granted) **EHS** C152D **ENV** M114, M134, M153, 157 **EPSS** 101, C113

**MAE** 103, 105A, 105D, 133A, 136, 150A, 150D, 174, 182A, 182B, 182C

Undergraduate Research Opportunities in Environmental Engineering

Students interested in participating in research in the area of environmental engineering are encouraged to contact directly the faculty instructors of the environmental engineering courses to see what research opportunities may be available.

Graduate Study in Environmental Engineering

Students wishing to enter a graduate program in environmental engineering should plan to take several additional courses. The following are the required preparatory courses for admission to the Environmental Engineering Masters Degree program at UCLA:

Chemistry and Biochemistry 20A, 20B, 20L; Mathematics 32A, 32B, 33A, 33B; Physics 1A/4AL, 1B; Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering 103, 105A; Civil and Environmental Engineering 151 or 153\. The Chemistry and Biochemistry 14 A/B/BL series, and the Physics 6 A/B series are also acceptable, but the Mathematics 3 A/B series does not lead to the differential equations course 33B, so students are advised to take the 31 A/B series. Any course that includes thermodynamics is acceptable in place of MAE 105A. Note that MAE 103 and 105A, and CEE 151 and 153 are all acceptable requirements for the Environmental Engineering Minor.

Environmental Engineering Masters degree programs at universities other than UCLA should have entrance requirements similar to those of UCLA, but students are encouraged to obtain information specific to the schools to which they plan to apply.

Students interested in environmental engineering careers should also take the Fundamentals of Engineering Exam (previously called the Engineer-in-Training Exam) - see [http://ncees.org/exams/fe-exam/](http://ncees.org/exams/fe-exam/). Students without an accredited Bachelors Degree can take this exam (in spite of what the website implies). Once the Master’s Degree is completed there is no issue about a non-engineering Bachelors Degree and students can eventually proceed to obtain the Professional Engineers license.

### Environmental Health Concentration {#environmental-health-concentration}

#### About the Minor {#about-the-minor-1}

[Environmental Health Sciences, Fielding School of Public Health](https://ehs.ph.ucla.edu/pages/)

Research in Environmental Health Sciences focus on the effects of biological, chemical and physical hazards in the environment on human and ecosystem health, and the means of managing these hazards. Coursework in pollutant sources, treatment, fate and management in the environment – soil, air, water, including urban environments – and the effect these pollutants have on human health is the primary focus of the coursework in this concentration.

SPECIAL NOTE: Unlike the other concentrations in the Environmental Science major, Environmental Health Sciences is NOT a minor. Students completing this concentration will NOT receive a notation on the transcript or diploma. However, students who successfully complete the concentration have been very successful professionally and especially in turning their experience into graduate school admissions. The EHS concentration allows only those few in the Environmental Science major to participate in courses that are otherwise only available to graduate students in Public Health. A high level of achievement in these graduate level courses is impressive to graduate schools in Public Health and related fields, and often yields strong recommendations from the faculty as well. A highly motivated undergraduate who does well in this concentration will absolutely not be disadvantaged by the lack of a minor on his or her record.
