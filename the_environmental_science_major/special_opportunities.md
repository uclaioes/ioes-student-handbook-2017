## **Special Opportunities** {#special-opportunities}

### **Summer Session** {#summer-session}

Summer session is a great way to get ahead, catch up, or help manage your schedule by taking courses at UCLA or elsewhere.

#### Summer At UCLA {#summer-at-ucla}

UCLA offers two sessions each summer, A and C session, which run from mid-June through July, and August through mid-September, respectively. Each 6-week session offers a variety of courses, including some that are tough to enroll in during the academic year but are easy to get into in the summer. All units, grades, and course credit automatically applies to your program, so there’s no hassle with sending transcripts or finding compatible equivalent courses, and you can be assured you’ll get the quality instruction you’ve come to expect at UCLA.

The official UCLA Summer Sessions schedule is on-line in January and registration for UCLA students begins in February. Two courses in a session is considered a full-time load due to the condensed nature of Summer Sessions.

UCLA summer session fees are charged on a per-unit fee basis. The unit maximum for summer is 18 units total, whether taken in a single session or multiple, although this can be increased with a petition to the College of L&amp;S at A316 Murphy Hall.

Financial aid is also available in summer; there is a unit minimum (6) and applications start in February, so don’t wait to apply for aid.

#### Summer at a Community College {#summer-at-a-community-college}

Taking summer courses at a **Community College** can be a low-cost and possibly local alternative for those who will be away from Los Angeles in the summer. Each community college releases its schedule for summer on different dates and enrollment is specific to the school. Community colleges only offer lower-division courses, so they can be a great way to complete GE requirements, language, or some lower-div prep courses, but in all cases you must consult with either the College (for GE/language) or the department to determine which courses will transfer to fulfill requirements.

Grades do not transfer from community colleges, although you must earn at least a C to get credit. Units will transfer until you reach 105 total units, after which time you can no longer accrue units from community college courses. This can be a good thing, as it can help keep your unit count below the maximum if you intend to take on an ambitious program or have taken many courses already. Course credit can apply but again, you must consult with the proper office to insure that the correct course for the requirement you wish to fulfill is being taken.

#### Summer at Another University {#summer-at-another-university}

Summer courses can also be taken at **another 4-year university**. There are thousands of public and private universities in the United States that offer summer session; therefore all courses taken at any other university must be approved in advance by petition to the department (for major or minor courses) or the College (for GE/College requirements).

If taken at any other University of California campus, in addition to course credit, the units and grades will transfer and affect your UC GPA. If taken at any other university, units and course credit can transfer but the grades will not affect your UC GPA (although at least a “C” grade is required to earn credit). As with Community Colleges, a transcript must be sent to UCLA following completion of the courses.

### **Study Abroad and Travel Study** {#study-abroad-and-travel-study}

The IoES encourages students to explore the many opportunities for study abroad available through UCLA and other campuses and organizations.

#### UC Education Abroad Program {#uc-education-abroad-program}

UC EAP is a UC-systemwide Education Abroad Program that specializes in semester or year-long study abroad at foreign universities. You can choose from hundreds of universities located in dozens of countries across the globe.

When choosing where to go, consider what is unique, special, and intriguing to you about the places you are considering and think about what sort of experience you want to have. Once you’ve figured that out, we here at the IoES can work with you and the EAP counselors to find the best fit for you. We can help figure out courses for you to take, so don’t become preoccupied with that.

For semester-length UC EAP programs, you will go, usually alone, to the foreign university and take the same courses with the resident population of students. It is an immersive experience in the culture, climate, and people of the location you choose. This type of cultural immersion is exciting and often a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, but it also requires maturity on the part of the participant as you will be away from nearly everything familiar to you for many months.

Because the Practicum occurs throughout senior year, we recommend that students plan for semester abroad programs like EAP to take place either during the Junior year, or in fall of a 5th year (13th semester) if that is viable for you. Fall is often favorable because you trade a fall quarter for a fall semester; spring semesters straddle the UCLA winter and spring quarter. However, this should be only one factor in your decision, which should also include the climate/season, finances, and other considerations.

#### Travel Study {#travel-study}

Travel Study, like EAP, offers students a unique experience, but usually these programs are shorter, focus on a specific site or topic of study in a region, and the majority of students and instructors will be from U.S. universities. Programs as short as one week or as long as a semester are available through travel study programs.

UCLA offers some in the summer, although at the moment we do not have any environment-specific travel study options. UC Davis, on the other hand, has many terrific summer programs that go to a variety of locales. In addition, other universities offer travel study programs that are open to any students in the USA and there are also privately run organizations that offer travel study.

Students should check with counselors both in the department appropriate to the field of study and in UC EAP to help determine transferability of any non-UC program.

#### UC Natural Reserve System: California Ecology and Conservation Field Course {#uc-natural-reserve-system-california-ecology-and-conservation-field-course}

The UC Natural Reserve System is a network of protected natural areas throughout California. Its 39 sites include more than 756,000 acres, making it the largest university-administered reserve system in the world. Most major state ecosystems are represented, from coastal tidepools to inland deserts, and lush wetlands to redwood forests. The reserves also serve as a gateway to more than a million acres of public lands. Founded in 1965 to provide undisturbed environments for research, education, and public service, the Natural Reserve System contributes to the understanding and wise stewardship of the earth.

The California Ecology and Conservation course brings together 27 students from across the UC system for seven weeks of intensive learning at NRS reserves. Guided by experienced field instructors, undergraduates transform into scientists by conducting independent research studies. Students learn to notice natural patterns, frame questions into feasible research projects, and practice standard techniques such as surveys of animal and plant populations. At the conclusion of each project, students analyze their data and present their findings to the class in oral presentations, posters, and reports. Students hone their research, public speaking, and scientific writing skills with constant practice and feedback. All the while, students gain a working familiarity with California’s diverse ecosystems while immersed in the NRS’s classrooms without walls.

California Ecology and Conservation is open to all University of California undergraduates in good standing with their home campus who have at least a 2.5 GPA and have passed an introductory ecology or biology course prior to applying for the program. Students receive 19 units of credit for the term; consult with your major and/or minor department for applicability of credit for your program. The program is offered in spring, summer, and fall.

### Double Major {#double-major}

Students wishing to double major are best served by identifying the two majors as early as possible in one’s academic career. The key to successfully double-majoring is planning in order to make sure the course load is manageable and to ensure completion within a reasonable time-to-degree, since nearly all double majors will exceed the unit maximum.

Double majors with BS in environmental science are always subject to approval by the College of L&amp;S (and if in another school at UCLA, such as HSSEAS or AA, approval by that school as well).

There is a process to declaring a double major. The first step is to devise a plan that accommodates all the courses necessary to complete both majors as well as the other requirements of the school to which you belong. This plan should be vetted by the SAOs from each department in which you will major.

To officially declare a double major, you must complete all preparatory courses for both majors, and at least two unique upper-division courses for each, prior to declaring. At that point you will have both departments review and sign-off on your course plan and then submit that to the College (and if applicable to the school to which you belong) for approval.

Up to 5 upper-division courses may overlap between the requirements for the majors involved. There is no limit on lower-division course overlap. The rules for minors still apply: 20 total units must be unique to any minor.

#### **Other Minors** {#other-minors}

In addition to the minor/concentration required of all environmental science majors, students are welcome to pursue any other minor offered at UCLA. The procedure for declaring a minor varies from minor to minor, so always check with the SAO for the department offering the minor.

One requirement is universal to all minors: 20 units must be unique to the minor (not overlapping with one’s major or another minor).
