## Tell Your Story {#tell-your-story}

Another thing that sets IoES apart is our focus on sharing what we discover with the world. We bring environmental science directly to the public and decision-makers who can truly make a difference, with:

* An online platform for students to publicly share [projects](https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/projects/?ioesyear=&ioestype=practicum-project&ioestopic=&Submit=Submit) and results
* Social media across multiple platforms:  [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/uclaioes), [Facebook](https://facebook.com/uclaioes/), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/uclaioes) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/4509089)
